Overview
--------

psl.survivor.* (survivor) is a non-workflow-implementation-specific
survivable framework for executing workflows.

The inital build contains a psl.survivor.nrl package, providing a
survivable adaptation of the framework for the Navy Research Lab's
workflow system.

Survivability is achieved by using Replicator Nodes that are
responsible for monitoring the execution of the workflow. In case that
a workflow branch is unable to succesfully succeed, Replicator Nodes
find the latest known execution of that branch (or potentially an
ancestor branch) and restart execution. The versioning mechanism is
the critical component of allowing the workflow to restart even if
much of the latest calculations are lost. In theory, a workflow branch
can be restarted from any point in its execution as long as we can get
to an ancestor version of that branch.

Survivor also uses mobile agents (psl.worklets) for communication
aspects between different processors. The idea being that smart agents
can be used to move version objects and restart the workflow.

Testing
-------

Survivor was tested on a completely connected workflow system. We
looked at both individual node and multiple node failures to test the
system.

In the future, we would like to test the survivablity of the system on
a non-connected graph representation of the workflow processors.  See
Survivor, SurvivorNG and Survivor007 papers for more details.


Development
-----------

The main purpose of this document is to help in the development and
extension of survivor. Following is a package overview.

*** psl.survivor: 
o todo.txt - list of future changes (todo) and changes recently
implemented (done)
o ProcessorMain.java - run an individual workflow processor and have
it join a group of processors ready to execute a workflow

*** psl.survivor.net:
This package uses worklets (psl.worklets) to implement communications
between different Task Processors.
o Capability.java - encapsulates the various task-processing of a Processor
o CloudNode.java - code actually responsible for using worklets to
communicate
o CompositeData.java - 
o MessageHandler.java - used by processor to communicate to other
Processors. This class is responsible for "packing" and "unpacking"
message sent via worklets. It invokes the proper callbacks on
processors when receiving messages.
o VTransportContainer.java - generic Serializable container used to
transport data from one Processor to another.

*** psl.survivor.proc:
This package most of the classes responsible for implementating
survivable Processing (aka executing workflows) and replication
(keeping track of the workflow and making sure its execution reaches
termination)

*** psl.survivor.proc.nrl:

*** psl.survivor.util:

*** psl.survivor.xml:
