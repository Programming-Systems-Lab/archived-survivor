All of the following workflows exhibit survivabilty scenarios on the
following workflow:

START -> start -> middle -> end -> END

Test 1 - workflow execution
node A: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp1.xml
node B: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp2.xml
node C: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp4.xml

start workflow on node A using the listener port
workflow runs to completion


Test 2 - workflow execution, kill needed node before the workflow gets
there.  By providing an alternate node with the needed capabilities,
the workflow will keep execution.

node A: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp1.xml
node B: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp2.xml
node C: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp3.xml
node D: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp4.xml

start workflow on node A using the listener port
kill node B before the workflow gets there
workflow will go to alternate node and run to completion


Test 3 - workflow execution, kill a node while the workflow is running
there.  Replicator nodes will notice that the workflow's execution was
compromised and will restart execution at the latest version.

node A: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp1.xml
node B: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp2.xml
node C: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp3.xml
node D: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp4.xml

start workflow on node A using the listener port
kill node B while the workflow is executing there
workflow node B crash will be detected
workflow will go to alternate node and run to completion.


Test 4 - workflow execution, kill a node while the workflow is running
there. Kill a replicator for that node. Another replicator will notice
that the workflow's execution was compromised and will restart
execution at the latest version.

node A: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp1.xml
node B: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp2.xml
node C: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp3.xml
node D: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp4.xml

start workflow on node A using the listener port
kill node B and node A while the workflow is executing on node B
workflow node B crash will be detected by a replicator other than A.
workflow will go to alternate node and run to completion.


Test 5 - workflow partial execution. provide a node to finish
execution dynamically. workflow will tun to completion.

node A: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp1.xml
node B: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp2.xml

start workflow on node A.
workflow will execute until node B.

dynamically provide
node C: psl.survivor.ProcessorMain with test\svrt\tp4.xml

workflow will detect node with enough capabilities and will run to
completion.
