- extract WF-Name from the XML file, and make available to Processor.java
- global logging + standardize error messages
- hierarchy for net/*containers -or- unify net/*containers into one
  container
- separate monitors (just check if a host is up) from replicators 
  (actually replicate data from a host)
- standardize some of the arguments and names of files
- differentiate between valid and ping (right now, they are treated
  the same in the net layer, which is dumb)
- make names in VTransportContainer more logical
- *** get rid of the ugliness in which the handles are being used. we
      should probably use some other class to invoke the transport
      layer cleanly.
- fix the replication of data (such as name, port and hostname) all
  over the place.
- swap the semantics meaning between valid and ping! It's currently
  the opposite of what it should be.
- get rid of 2 objects in Version object
