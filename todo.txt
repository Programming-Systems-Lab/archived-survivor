- fix XML schema to be more reflective of the XML we are actually using

- what to do when receive multiple requests to kill a certain task?
- shutdown on Processor should do some cleanup:
        + inform peers that it is going down
        + maybe if some task is still running, refuse to shutdown, etc


- what to do if receive request to run a task that is already executing, but
  hasn't completed ... ie. is an 'endangered task'

- GSKC: stop task ... done, I think ... 
        shutdown cloud ... done, but need cleanup

- JD: need to fix the versioning to have 3 version
      much other stuff

- JD: get Replicators working by default in the ProcessorMain, fix STOP-TASK
  Gskc: use reflection to obtain processor-TYPE


- WVM should be created before the ServiceHost_Serv ++ NRLProcessor coz it 
 needs the rmiregistry ... or in the very least, the ServiceHost_Serv should 
 be created *after* the WVM .... might wanna make this a singleton 
 ServiceHost_Serv, btw

- need to either change the RMI name for the ServiceHost_Serv to 
  <taskName>-serviceHost, or not use RMI at all here .. 

- create a different ServiceHost_Serv/Scheduler_Serv for every invocation 
   of executeTaskLocal in NRLProcessor


- fix problem when a remoteTaskProcessor is really local (make it be a local
  call instead of using worklets)
- global logging + standardize error messages
- hierarchy for net/*containers -or- unify net/*containers into one
  container
- separate monitors (just check if a host is up) from replicators 
  (actually replicate data from a host)
- standardize some of the arguments and names of files
- differentiate between valid and ping (right now, they are treated
  the same in the net layer, which is dumb)
- make names in VTransportContainer more logical
- *** get rid of the ugliness in which the handles are being used. we
      should probably use some other class to invoke the transport
      layer cleanly.
- fix the replication of data (such as name, port and hostname) all
  over the place.
- swap the semantics meaning between valid and ping! It's currently
  the opposite of what it should be.
- get rid of 2 objects in Version object
